God Clash is a local pvp game made with the Unity game engine. It consists of astronaut (first player, Saturn god of time), terrain of matrix-like placed blocks that astronaut can move on, finish which is placed on the most distanced block from astronaut and opposing player (Jupyter god of space).

The goal for Saturn is straightforward, reach the finish by crossing terrain using wasd keys or arrow keys for moving and space button for teleporting in 2d space before time runs.

While, on the other hand, the opposing player wins if time runs out before the astronaut reaches finish.

Jupyter has 2 abilities, the first one being the ability to elevate mentioned blocks, and by doing that "walls" are created on terrain which forces Saturn to go around them.

Jupyter can arise blocks by dragging the mouse over grounded blocks while holding left-click.

This is balanced by limiting Jupyter with how many blocks can be elevated at the moment. When the limit is exceeded, the first block that was elevated will fall down and become ground that astronaut can again walk on.

Jupyter can never trap an astronaut in walls and make reaching finish impossible because his goal is not to make reaching finish for astronaut imposible, but harder (there is always one path that leads to finish).

The second ability of Jupyter can be used only once, and it is ability to move finish by clicking right click with mouse on grounded block.

Saturn has one ability, which is to teleport astronaut where he was 5 seconds ago. This ability has cooldown of 5 seconds and is used to trick Jupyter and make reaching finish easier.

There is a clone of astronaut that follows real astronaut and is representing where he was 5 seconds ago so it makes easier to tell where astronaut will be teleported by using ability
